High‑performance financial charting library for OHLC data visualization with technical indicators.

## Overview

PyCharting lets you render large OHLC time series (hundreds of thousands to millions of candles) in the browser with a single Python call.  
It runs a lightweight FastAPI server locally, streams your data to a uPlot-based frontend, and gives you an interactive viewport with overlays and indicator subplots.

## Features

- **Million‑point OHLC charts**: optimized for large datetime indices and dense intraday data.
- **Timeseries x‑axis**: pass a `pd.DatetimeIndex` or Unix‑ms timestamps and the chart renders proper date/time labels that adapt to the zoom level.
- **Overlays on price**: moving averages, EMAs, or any arbitrary overlay series.
- **Indicator subplots**: RSI, MACD, volume, or any series rendered as separate panels with synced crosshair. Supports line, bar, and scatter rendering per series.
- **Multi-series subplots**: a single panel can contain multiple series with mixed types — e.g., MACD line + signal line + histogram bars, or RSI with a moving-average overlay in a different color.
- **Trade markers**: plot buy/sell arrows directly on the price chart from a simple `+1`/`-1`/`0` signal array.
- **Viewport management**: server‑side slicing and caching for smooth pan/zoom on huge arrays.
- **Measurement tool**: Shift‑click to measure price delta, percentage change, and time between two points.
- **FastAPI + uPlot stack**: Python on the backend, ultra‑light JS on the frontend.
- **Simple Python API**: one main entry point, `plot(...)`, plus helpers to manage the server.

## Installation

### From PyPI

Install the latest released version from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pycharting
```

This will install the `pycharting` package along with its runtime dependencies (`numpy`, `pandas`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, and friends).

### From source

If you want to develop or run against `main`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alihaskar/pycharting.git
cd pycharting
pip install -e .
```

If you use Poetry instead of pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alihaskar/pycharting.git
cd pycharting
poetry install
```

## Quick start

The primary API is a single `plot` function that takes OHLC arrays (plus optional overlays and subplots), starts a local server, and opens your default browser on the interactive chart.
You normally import everything you need like this:

```python
from pycharting import plot, stop_server, get_server_status
```

When you run this script, PyCharting will:

- spin up a local FastAPI server on an available port,
- register your OHLC series and overlays in a session,
- open your default browser to a minimal full‑page chart UI showing price and overlays.

## Overlays vs subplots

Once you have your OHLC series, you pass additional series to `plot` in two different ways:

```python
overlays = {
    "SMA_50": sma(close, 50),      # rendered on top of price
    "EMA_200": ema(close, 200),
}

subplots = {
    "RSI_like": rsi_like_series,   # rendered in its own panel below price
    "Stoch_like": stoch_series,
}

plot(
    index,
    open_,
    high,
    low,
    close,
    overlays=overlays,
    subplots=subplots,
)
```

- **Overlays** share the same y‑axis as price and are drawn directly on the candlestick chart (moving averages, bands, signals on price).
- **Subplots** are stacked independent charts below the main panel with their own y‑scales (oscillators, volume, breadth measures).

### Subplot series types

Each subplot value can be a plain array (line), a dict with options, or a list of dicts for multi-series panels:

```python
subplots = {
    # Simple line (default)
    "RSI": rsi_array,

    # Bar chart — green if value ≥ 0, red if < 0, centered at y=0
    "Volume": {"data": volume_array, "type": "bar"},

    # Scatter plot
    "Events": {"data": events_array, "type": "scatter", "color": "#9C27B0"},

    # Multi-series panel: two lines + histogram bars in one subplot
    "MACD": [
        {"data": macd_line,   "type": "line", "color": "#2196F3", "label": "MACD"},
        {"data": signal_line, "type": "line", "color": "#FF9800", "label": "Signal"},
        {"data": histogram,   "type": "bar",                      "label": "Histogram"},
    ],

    # RSI with its own moving average overlay
    "RSI+SMA": [
        {"data": rsi,     "type": "line", "color": "#FF9800", "label": "RSI"},
        {"data": rsi_sma, "type": "line", "color": "#2196F3", "label": "RSI SMA(20)"},
    ],
}
```

Supported series types: `"line"` (default), `"bar"`, `"scatter"`. Each entry accepts optional `"color"` (hex string) and `"label"` (legend text).

## Trade markers

You can overlay buy/sell arrows on the price chart by passing a `trades` array aligned with your index. Values: `1` (buy), `-1` (sell), `0` (no trade).

```python
import numpy as np

trades = np.zeros(len(index), dtype=int)
trades[42] = 1    # buy at bar 42
trades[100] = -1   # sell at bar 100

plot(
    index,
    open=open_,
    high=high,
    low=low,
    close=close,
    trades=trades,
)
```

Buy signals render as green upward arrows below the low; sell signals render as red downward arrows above the high.

See `demo.py` for a full example that generates synthetic data and wires up overlays, subplots, and trade markers.

Run the demo from the project root:

```bash
python demo.py
```

You should see something similar to the screenshot above: a price panel with overlays, plus RSI-like and stochastic-like subplots underneath.

## Python API

The public API is intentionally small and focused. All functions are available from the top-level `pycharting` package.

### `plot`

```python
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional, Union

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pycharting import plot

ArrayLike = Union[np.ndarray, pd.Series, list]

result: Dict[str, Any] = plot(
    index: ArrayLike,
    open: ArrayLike,
    high: ArrayLike,
    low: ArrayLike,
    close: ArrayLike,
    overlays: Optional[Dict[str, ArrayLike]] = None,
    subplots: Optional[Dict[str, ArrayLike]] = None,
    trades: Optional[ArrayLike] = None,
    session_id: str = "default",
    port: Optional[int] = None,
    open_browser: bool = True,
    server_timeout: float = 2.0,
)
```

- **index**: datetime x-axis values — `pd.DatetimeIndex`, Unix timestamps in milliseconds (`np.int64`), or a numeric array.
- **open/high/low/close**: price series of identical length.
- **overlays**: mapping of overlay name to series (same length as `close`), rendered on the main price chart.
- **subplots**: mapping of subplot name to series data. Values can be a plain array (line chart), `{"data": array, "type": "bar"|"scatter"|"line", "color": "#hex"}` for a single series with options, or a list of such dicts for multi-series panels. Rendered as additional charts stacked vertically.
- **trades**: array of `+1` (buy), `-1` (sell), `0` (no trade) signals, same length as `index`. Renders arrows on the price chart.
- **session_id**: identifier for the data session; can be used to host multiple concurrent charts.
- **port**: optional port override; if `None`, PyCharting picks an available port.
- **open_browser**: if `False`, you get the URL back in `result["url"]` but the browser is not opened automatically.

The returned dict includes:

- `status`: `"success"` or `"error"`,
- `url`: full chart URL (including session query),
- `server_url`: base FastAPI server URL,
- `session_id`: the session identifier you passed in,
- `data_points`: number of OHLC rows,
- `server_running`: boolean.

### `stop_server`

```python
from pycharting import stop_server

stop_server()
```

Stops the active chart server if it is running. This is useful in long‑running processes and demos to clean up after you are done exploring charts.

### `get_server_status`

```python
from pycharting import get_server_status

status = get_server_status()
print(status)
```

Returns a small dict with:

- `running`: whether the server is alive,
- `server_info`: host/port and other metadata if running,
- `active_sessions`: number of registered data sessions.
